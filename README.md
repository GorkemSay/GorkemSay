**Hi there ðŸ‘‹**

Welcome to my GitHub profile.
My name is GÃ¶rkem Say, from Turkey.

I am a computer engineer student at Ã‡ukurova University. Currently, I am learning Swift ï£¿ with UIKit and working on it. I am always trying to grow and learning new things.
I love both software and hardware side of technology. I am interested in microprocessor architectures <a href="https://emoji.gg/emoji/CPU"><img src="https://emoji.gg/assets/emoji/CPU.png" width="20px" height="20px" alt="CPU"></a> as a hobby.
